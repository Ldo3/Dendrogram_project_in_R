In website contains our additional experiment in the paper of [Dendrogram of mixing measures: Hierarchical clustering and model selection for finite mixture models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01684).

Currently, we have 2 versions of code for Dendrogram one in Python language and one in R. The R code is provided here. We compare the running time of the Dendrogram post-processing method (applied to overfitted mixture models) to the traditional approach of fitting mixture models with various numbers of components using the \texttt{Mclust} package in the programming language R. Please set the link below for more detail of the experiment
